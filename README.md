# AnkiWriting-Public
A program to create your own designed Anki flash cards by a text list.
First read the word file 'Anki import explanation' and do what it describes.
The .exe file for the program is in the folder 'AnkiWriting'. The other folder 'DO NOT CHANGE' is for the initialisation every time the program starts so don't delete or change the folder or any file inside it. If you for example deleted it then don't worry. The program will create it at the next start of the program but the settings will be the default settings.
